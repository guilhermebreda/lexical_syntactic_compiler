# lexical_syntactic_compiler

The main goal of this project was to create a lexical and syntactic compiler for C language.

The lexical analysis is able to analyze C language and identify each word/token and assign a meaning to it.
The syntactic analysis verify the language syntax, its grammar rules.

We choose Python language for the structure of this program which is based on 23 functions.
